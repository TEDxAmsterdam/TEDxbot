# Currently this project is on hold
Due to time constraints this project is currently on hold. Perhaps in the future we can continue on this, but with TEDxAmsterdam 2016 being held at the 18th of November there is too little time to succesfully finalize this project. Thanks for your interest!

# TEDxBot

# Goal of the Project
The TEDxBot is the first part of the new TEDxAmsterdam website experience. Through a conversation, which originates from Ideas Worth Spreading, the organisation of the event gain an understanding of TEDx enthusiasts who would like to attend TEDxAmsterdam. Through a series of questions the bot gains an insight in the person and eventually allows for inviting a diverse mix of attendees. 

# Current State 
The current bot is available for testing at http://tedxchatbot.herokuapp.com/. Please feel free to test it out and submit any issues or pull requests to help improve the bot. 

# How to contribute
There is a Slack available for discussion, please register at http://dev.tedx.asterdam/ to receive an invite. Developers, designers and strategists collaborate for this project. Otherwise the issue and pull request features of GitHub are the way to go.
